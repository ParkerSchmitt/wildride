# Deer

![Sketch depicting a deer.](wildride/images/kansasoutdoors/kso.jpg)


## Background-information:

Started observing the deer around 2:51 PM, and ended around 3:10 PM. When I was watching the deer, the temperature outside was around 28 degrees and had some cold winds coming in from the north. The deer were located in a semi-wooded area that ran next to a small creek, next to the Nash Boy Scouts of America east property line.

## Descriptions of plants and animals:

Around the deer, there was quite a bit of vegetation. There were several small and large trees, all of which were without leaves. There was also a small patch of tall grass to the right of the deer, that had occasional sprouts of mullein plants. There were also a couple of other animals around or close to the deer. I saw a handful of birds fly onto the trees next to the deer (one of which I am certain was a male Cardinal), and a few other birds that I couldn’t identify for sure.

##Description of the deer:

The herd of deer I saw was small. They were roughly 300 feet away from me, and one or two of them was out of sight, obscured by a tree in front of them. However, I am certain that I saw a doe and slightly younger/shorter doe. The deer themselves were a light tan color, white some whiter patches on their stomach, around their eyes and on the back of their thighs. The adult doe that I saw was around 4 feet tall (from hove to ear), and the younger fawn was a little bit smaller, around 3-3.5 feet tall. Along with that, none of the deer that I saw had antlers.

## The behavior of the deer:

Though I didn’t get to observe the deer for too long, I did notice some interesting behavior from them. The younger doe would always stay close to the adult one, even if the older one walked away a little bit. The deer would also periodically left one of their front legs, and look in some direction as if staying on alert for danger. One thing that struck me as odd was the fact that they wouldn’t do much else. They lowered their heads to eat once or twice, but besides that they just walked around, not moving far from their original spot.
Though after a few minutes, they did notice me. Upon noticing me, they raised their heads, started at me for a second, and trotted away in the opposite direction of me, which was up a hill.

## Reflections:

For the most part, I think this observation was a success. I didn’t intentionally scare the deer away like the geese, and I was able to observe the deer in their natural setting, without being aware they were under the presence of a human. Though if I had to redo this again, I probably would have tried harder to be hidden. Instead of standing up and writing down their behaviors, I would have instead laid down on the ground, cover myself in a few leaves, and not make any sudden fast movements with my hands or body; that way I would be able to observe them longer. Though asides from that, I think today was mostly a success, and I had a lot of fun watching the deer.
