# Canadian Goose

## Background-information: 

Started watching the Canadian geese at 4:10 PM, and ended around 5:00 PM. Currently, the temperature is 42 degrees Fahrenheit but feels around a few degrees cooler with winds that feel like they are coming from the north. The geese are located on the ice, close to the north side of the small island on the lake, in Lake of the Forest.

## Description of plants and animals:

Currently, there are no other animals nearby, apart from the Canadian Geese. However, close by on the island, there are a lot of plants. Right near the north tip of the island is a large pine tree (around 45 feet tall), two small, dead willow trees on either side of the island and some dead wild onion plants on the northeast end of the island. However, occasionally another bird will fly next to the geese (such as a cardinal spotted 5 minutes prior to writing this), and the geese will pay little to no attention to it.

## Description of the Canadian Geese:

The geese are large, brown birds. They are roughly 2 feet long, and a foot wide (not including wingspan). Standing up and, they can get about 3 feet tall. The geese, for the most part, look the same, with a brown on their backs, wings, and on the top of their legs. Their head, beak and neck, tail, and legs are almost completely black, with only a small white dash on either side of the, and face (right below their eye), standing out. Their stomach, for the most part, is completely white, with a few Grey and tan feathers poking out. The only part of them that isn’t covered in feathers or fuzz (apart from their beak) is their legs, which are made up of small, reflective scales.

## Behavior:

Right now, the geese are mostly inactive. They are all grouped together on the ice, with most of them laying down, with their headers and neck tucked in on top of their body. However, there are a couple (5 that I can count) geese that are standing up, and watching me as I observe them. When I got closer to the geese, the ones that I assume were “keeping watch” started backing away, and were honked a few times. Then slowly, the other geese that were lying down either started to get up and on their feet, or lifted their heads to watch me. As I got even closer, some of them started flying a couple dozen feet away, to the back of the “pack”.

## Reflections:

After observing the geese, I think there were several things I would have done differently. First, I think I would have written about their behaviors first instead of drawing first, as by the time that I was done with the drawing many of the geese had left. I think I would also be more patient next time when observing the geese (or any animal, for that matter), as they might have decided to do something else besides flying away, such as going to eat grass or walk around the island.
While I was watching them, I was sort of confused why they resting on the ice, but after thinking about it for awhile, I think I have a pretty good hypothesis. I’m guessing they were resting on the ice because they were migrating or traveling somewhere, and Lake of The Forest was just a resting point for them. This would also explain why all of the geese that I observed today did not have any Lake of The Forest bands on their neck.
However, overall I think today went pretty good. I learned a lot about observing wildlife, what to look for in their behaviors, and I am feeling improvement in my ability to draw what I am observing.
